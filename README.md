Hi! I'm [Alejandro Sanchez @alesanchezr](https://github.com/alesanchezr), really excited to have you here! 🎉 😂 Learning to code is hard, you need coaching! [DM me on twitter](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr) if you have any questions.

Complete selection of autograded CSS exercises, for anyone interested in learning CSS!

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/css-tutorial-exercises-course) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/css-tutorial-exercises-course.git).

> Once you have VSCode open the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Manual installation

1) Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the node compiler plugin for LearnPack, make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```bash
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-html
```

2) Download the exercises 

```bash
$ learnpack install css-tutorial-exercises-course
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will need to `cd` into the exercises folder which contains all the exercises.

3) Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
$ learnpack start
```
<!-- endhide -->

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **index.html:** all websites and exercises start from the index.html.
2. **styles.css:** your CSS code goes here, some exercises will make you update this file.
3. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
4. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion or you may get frustrated.
