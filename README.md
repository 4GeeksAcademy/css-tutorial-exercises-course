## One click installation:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/css-tutorial-exercises-course)

## Manual installation

1) Install the learnpack package manager for education and the html plugin to compile an test html exercises: 

```
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-html
```

2) Download the exercises 

```bash
$ learnpack install css-tutorial-exercises-course
```

Note: Once you finish downloading, you will need to `cd` into the exercises folder and you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3) Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level were your learn.json file is:

```sh
$ npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
$ learnpack start
```

Note: The exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and strict, my recomendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recomendation or you can get frustrated.

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **index.html:** all websites and exercises start from the index.html
2. **styles.css:** your CSS code goes here, some exercises will make you update this file
3. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
4. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
