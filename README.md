Hi! I'm [Alejandro Sanchez @alesanchezr](https://github.com/alesanchezr), really excited to have you here! 🎉 😂 Learning to code is hard, you need coaching! [DM me on twitter](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr) if you have any questions.

## You'll be learning the following concepts:

1. How to apply CSS to your website in 3 different ways: Inline, by grouping them together inside a `<style>` tag, or using an external stylesheet `<link>`.

2. Selecting HTML Elements from your website to apply the styles to.

3. Apply CSS Rules (styles) to those elements.

4. Use the most popular CSS Rules.

5. Learn the most popular CSS Tricks.

Note: The exercises have automatic grading but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion or you may get frustrated.

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **index.html:** all websites and exercises start from the index.html.
2. **styles.css:** your CSS code goes here, some exercises will make you update this file.
3. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
4. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
