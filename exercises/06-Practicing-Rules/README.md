# `06` Practicing Rules

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Set this URL as the background image of the page, and repeat it vertically only: `../../.learn/assets/background-vertical.jpg?raw=true`

2. Change the font-type of the `h1` to `Courier` and the rest of the website to `Times new Roman`.

3. Change the color of `h1` to `red`.

4. Make all the `h2's` with an `underline`.

5. Center the `h1` to the middle.

6. Add a `left padding` to the whole document of `20px` to make it easier to read.

7. Add a white `semi-transparent background (0.2)` to the `first paragraph` to make it easier to read (you have tu use rgba for that) and write down "3 reasons you know you are learning". Then apply a `padding` of `5px` to all sides of that paragraph.

8. Change the `anchor` "hover" color to `green` and remove the underline (you have to actually hover the anchor to test it).

## The result should be something like this:
