# `06` Practicing Rules

## 📝 Instructions:


1. Set this URL as the background image of the page, and repeat it vertically only:
   http://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/bg/background-vertical.jpg

2. Change the font-type of the h1 to Courier
   and the rest of the website to Times new Roman.

3. Change the color of h1 to red.

4. Make all the h2's with an underline.

5. Center the h1 to the middle.

6. Add a left padding to the whole document
   of 20px to make it easier to read.

7. Add a white semi-transparent background (0.2) to the first paragraph
   of "3 reasons you know you are learning" to make it easier to
   read (you have tu use rgba for that), and then apply a padding
   of 5px to all sides of that paragraph.

8. Change the anchor "hover" color to green and remove the underline.
   (you have to actually hover the anchor to test it).


The result should be something like this:
