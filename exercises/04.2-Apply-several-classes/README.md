# `04.2` Apply several classes

We have prepared a small CSS Stylesheet that contains the CSS styles to replicate poker cards.

We are going to use to classes and apply them to the same `<div>` element.

```html
<div class="card spades">9</div>
```

The class `card` contains the styling rules to make the div look like a card: Borders, Height, Width, etc.
The class `spades` contains the styling rules needed to make the card turn into a spades suite (black and with a spades symbol).

There are two possible suite classes you can apply to the html element to make it look like a real poker card.

## 📝 Instructions:

Replace the class property `spades` of the `<div>` with the class `heart` and look at the results.


## Expected result:

![Poker Card Heart](../../.learn/assets/04.2-1.png?raw=true)
