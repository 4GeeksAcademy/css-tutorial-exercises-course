# `03` Inline Styles

Inline styles are a very bad idea unless you have no other choice (and that's a very uncommon situation). Sadly, we have to teach you how to do it because you may need to use them at some point.

To use inline styles, instead of declaring a <style> tag in the header of the document, you have to set the "style" attribute of any element with the CSS code you need to apply to that specific element.

For example:

```html
<a href="google.com" style="color: red; font-size: 14px;">Go to google</a>
```

Will set the color of that specific link to red and the font-size to 14px

*You can append as many CSS rules as you want, within the same line, separated by semi-colon.*

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Set an inline style to change the background color of the table to green. For this exercise, do NOT use styles.css :(
