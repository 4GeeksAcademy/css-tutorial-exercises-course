# `01` Hello World in CSS

CSS is about styles. To apply styles you always have to follow this steps:

1. Read the HTML and pick in your mind what element you want to decorate or apply styles to.
1. Programatically select the element you want to style using CSS Selectors.
2. Write the styling that you want by using CSS rules.

That is it! The rest is just semantics! 😁

Look at this example:

```HTML
<style>
    a {
        /* change this style to yellow */
        color: pink;
    }
</style>
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Click me to open google.com</a>
```
