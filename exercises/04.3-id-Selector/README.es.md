# `04` Class Selector

You can also select an element by `#id` and apply stiles to it.

#### The `#id` selector

```css
#small{
    font-size: 9px;
}
```
Use the id property of the HTML element to select it. IDs should be unique, only one element must have the same ID.
Note: The html tag with the `id="my_number_one"` will have a font-size of 9px.

# 📝 Instructions:

Add the id `button1` on to the `<span>` tag and compile to check the result on the console.
