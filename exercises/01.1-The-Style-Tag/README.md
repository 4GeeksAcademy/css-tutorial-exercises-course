# `01.1` The Style Tag

A more efficient approach to adding styles into your webpages is by writing your CSS in a `<style>` tag, within the head section of your HTML code.

You can have as many style tags as you want but it is recomended to have only one at the beginning of your website code.

```HTML
<style>
    /* the website CSS Styles go here */
</style>
```

## 📝 Instructions

1. Add a `<style>` tag into your website
2. Using CSS properties select all `<p>` tags to turn their text color to blue.
3. Make the font (text) twice its original size - use the `em` units. 
4. Give the `p` tag padding of `2rem`.

### 💡 Hint

- Remember that you will need the complete html structure of the page, because the `style` tags need to go inside of the `head` tags.
