# `02` Separate Stylesheet

If you use the html `<link>` tag, you can also have your styles on a separate file that we usually call `styles.css`.

That is an even better practice because it lets you have an CSS agnostic website, you can change the CSS later and make the website look 100% different, but still have the same exact HTML.

## 📝 Instructions:

Fill the `styles.css` with the content needed to make the website body blue.

## 💡Hint:

+ Google how to change the `background-color` of a website body.
