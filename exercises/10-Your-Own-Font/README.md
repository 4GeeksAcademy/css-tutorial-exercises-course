# `10` Your Own Font

Yo canfind Google Fonts here: https://fonts.google.com

Pick your favorite one, and then use it by linking your website with the URL in which the font is stored. You have to do that in the `<head>` tag of the HTML document like this:

```Plain/Text
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=YOUR_FONT" rel="stylesheet">
```

After your font is linked you need to assign the `font-family` CSS rule to whatever you want to apply the font, for example an `<h1>`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Link any google-font that you like into the website.

2. Apply that specific `font-family` to `#myTitle`.
