# `10` Your Own Font

Google Fonts can be found here: https://fonts.google.com

After you pick your favorite one, you can use it by linking your website with the URL in which the font is stored. You have to do that in the <head> tag of the HTML document like this:

```Plain/Text
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=YOUR_FONT" rel="stylesheet">
```

After your font is linked you need to assign the "font-family" CSS rule to whatever you want to apply the font, for example an <h1>.

## 📝 Instructions:


1. Link any google-font that you like into the website.
2. Apply that specific font-family to #myTitle.
