# `13` Anchor Like Button

Anchors are not only used within text- when you are going to use anchors outside text, it is better to make them look like buttons for a more user-friendly experience.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Make it look like a box: Set `padding` to `10px`.

2. Rounded borders: Set `border-radius` to `4px`.

3. Find and apply the color: Use the color picker to find the color and apply make the background to that color.

4. Remove underline: Set `text-decoration` to `none`.

5. Set the color of the text to `white`.

*To make the button look different when the user hovers over with the mouse, we use the `:hover` selector: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+use+the+hover*

6. Inside of the `:hover` selector change the background of the button to a `darker orange`.
