# `01.3` Your Second Style

When doing CSS, the idea is to apply `css rules` to your `html elements`, you always have to select the element first, and then specify what rules you want to apply to it:

For example, this is the code if I want to make all my website anchors (`<a> tag's`) blue:

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Make your website background blue by selecting the `body` and applying the `background` rule with a `blue` value.

2. Build and preview the exercise and your result should be a blue `body` (the whole page blue).
