			<h2>3 reasons you know you are learning</h2>
			<p id="id1">
				We are going to explain in this paragraph the 3 most common signs that you should look into yourself to recognize if you are learning.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You are able to complete the exercises by yourself.</li>
				<li>You understand what the teacher is talking about.</li>
				<li>You are able to have conversations about the topic.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>3 reasons you love what you are learning</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Time passes fast.</li>
				<li>You are anxious to finish this exercise and start the next one.</li>
				<li>It's 12am and you don't want to go to sleep.</li>
			</ul>
