		<h2>3 reasons you know you are learning</h2>
		<p id="id1">
			We are going to explain in this paragraph the 3 most common signs that you should look into yourself to recognize if you are learning.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You are able to complete the exercises by yourself.</li>
			<li>You understand what the teacher is talking about</li>
			<li>You are able to have conversations about the topic</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>3 reasons you know love what you are learning</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Time passes fast.</li>
			<li>You are anxious to finish this exercise and start the next one.</li>
			<li>It's 12am and you don't want to go to sleep.</li>
		</ul>
